# Ghost Hunter README

## Description

This a game that is based on Nintendo's Luigi's Mansion (but slightly more morbid) in which the goal of the game is to find all the ghosts within a given timeframe (30 seconds).

## Directions
Using the handy flashlight at the start of the game and the arrow keys (left, up, right, down), to move through a grid system in order to find all the ghosts on the board (which vary game to game).

If you do not find all the ghosts within 30 seconds, you lose-- and you will be possessed!

However, if you happen to find all the ghosts in 30 seconds, you win-- and you will become a successful exorcist!

### Issues/Bugs
Currently, the game does not work as the keydown associated with moving through the cells in the grid has errors.
