Ghost Hunter is a game that is based on Nintendo's Luigi's Mansion (but slightly more morbid) in which the goal of the game is to find all the ghosts within a given timeframe (30 seconds).
Using the handy flashlight at the start of the game and the arrow keys (left, up, right, down), move through a grid system to find all the ghosts on the board (which vary game to game).
Currently, the game does not work as the keydown associated with moving through the cells in the grid has errors.
