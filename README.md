#Ghost Hunter README

##Description

This a game that is based on Nintendo's Luigi's Mansion (but slightly more morbid) in which the goal of the game is to find all the ghosts within a given timeframe (30 seconds).

##Directions
Using the handy flashlight at the start of the game and the arrow keys (left, up, right, down), move through a grid system to find all the ghosts on the board (which vary game to game).

If you do not find all the ghosts within 30 seconds, you lose.

However, if you happen to find all the ghosts in 30 seconds, you win!

###Issues/Bugs
Currently, the game does not work as the keydown associated with moving through the cells in the grid has errors.

## Description

This a game that is based on Nintendo's Luigi's Mansion (but slightly more morbid) in which the goal of the game is to find all the ghosts within a given timeframe (30 seconds).

## Directions
Using the handy flashlight at the start of the game and the arrow keys (left, up, right, down), move through the board to find all the ghosts (which vary game to game-- so you'll want to keep playing).

If you do not find all the ghosts within 30 seconds, you lose-- and you will be possessed!

However, if you happen to find all the ghosts in 30 seconds, you win-- and you will become a successful exorcist!

## Issues/Bugs
Currently, the game does not work as the keydown associated with moving through the cells in the grid has errors.

Win/lose logic has also not been created.
